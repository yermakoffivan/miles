description: The three kinds of CI label — domain labels that gate tests, scope labels that broaden selection, and bypass-fastfail.
---
A label is a GitHub PR label that changes what CI runs or how it fails. Three kinds:

| Kind | Example | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Domain label | `run-ci-megatron` | selects which tests run |
| Scope label | `run-ci-image` | run every enabled tag except `long`, `ft-short`, and `ft-long` |
| Cadence/scope label | `nightly` | select nightly cadence and every enabled tag except `long` and `ft-long`, with fast-fail disabled |
| Scope label | `run-ci-all` | run every enabled tag |
| Behavior label | `bypass-fastfail` | opt out of fast-fail; one run surfaces every failure |

Only domain labels are declared in `labels=[...]`; scope and behavior labels are workflow inputs resolved by `tests/ci/ci_policy.py`. The separate `nightly=True` registration field is a cadence gate described below.

## Domain labels: `register_*_ci(labels=...)` ↔ `run-ci-<x>`

A test declares its labels: `register_cuda_ci(..., labels=["megatron"])`. The PR trigger for `<x>` is the GitHub label `run-ci-<x>`. The workflow forwards canonical CI labels to `run_suite.py --labels`; Python strips the `run-ci-` prefix and intersects with each test's labels.

| Test declares | Runs when |
|---|---|
| CPU `labels=[]` (or omitted) | every run whose cadence admits the test (always-on within that cadence) |
| `labels=["megatron"]` | PR has `run-ci-megatron` |
| `labels=["sglang"]` | PR has `run-ci-sglang` |
| `labels=["fsdp", "lora"]` | PR has `run-ci-fsdp` or `run-ci-lora` |

PR labels without the `run-ci-` prefix are ignored.

CUDA and ROCm registrations must declare at least one domain label. GPU runners are scarce and expensive, so an always-on GPU test would defeat the purpose of selecting only the GPU coverage a PR requests.

### The canonical label list

Domain labels live in `tests/ci/labels.py` (`KNOWN_LABELS`); a `labels=[...]` value outside it is a hard error. Current set: `megatron`, `model-scripts`, `sglang`, `fsdp`, `short`, `long`, `ckpt`, `lora`, `precision`, `ft-short`, `ft-long`, `weight-update`, `replay`, `qwen35`, `mooncake`.

To add one: add the entry to `KNOWN_LABELS`, then create the matching `run-ci-<key>` label on the PR. No workflow edit needed.

## Manage CI from PR comments

The PR-comment entrypoint is a command gateway rather than a label handler. Each recognized comment becomes a typed request, and a code-defined static registry selects its fixed handler, policy key, and token capability. The JSON policy controls only access groups and per-command resource allowlists. The registry currently implements add-label, clear-labels, and rerun-failed-ci requests; it does not implement the planned test-case command.

After the comment gateway is enabled, post `/<label>` as the entire comment on an open PR to append that exact label. The label must be a supported `run-ci-*` label or `bypass-fastfail` and must be listed in `.github/workflows/policies/comment-command-access.json`; for example, `/run-ci-short` appends only `run-ci-short`, while `/bypass-fastfail` appends only `bypass-fastfail`.

The command permits leading and trailing whitespace only; it cannot include arguments, prose, or a second command. If the label is already present, the request succeeds as a no-op and does not emit another `labeled` event or rerun CI.

`.github/workflows/policies/comment-command-access.json` is an exact, default-deny ACL. Its `commands.add_label.allowed_labels` array controls which exact labels can be added through comments; adding a `KNOWN_LABELS` entry does not expose it automatically. Other command entries select an access group but cannot select a handler, token capability, workflow, API endpoint, or shell command.

The `add_label_access` group controls every command that adds a label. A caller belongs to this group when either their live legacy permission on `radixark/miles` appears in `repository_permissions` or their stable numeric GitHub user ID appears in `user_ids`.

The initial policy accepts `write` and `admin` and starts with no explicit user IDs. Workflow owners can grant a contributor label-command access by adding only that numeric ID to the JSON policy, without granting repository write access. GitHub reports the `maintain` role as legacy `write`; custom roles follow their base repository access.

The `repo_write_access` group restricts `/clear-labels` and `/rerun-failed-ci` to live `write` or `admin` permission. Only `add_label_access` can contain explicit `user_ids`; those IDs do not grant either non-label operation.

Unrecognized comments exit after trusted parsing with capability `none`; they do not load the access policy, call the GitHub API, or mint an App token. A malformed comment containing one of the recognized command markers still fails instead of being treated as an unrelated comment.

The gateway controls only the delegated comment path; it does not restrict users' existing GitHub UI/API label permissions and does not offer commands that add `run-ci-all`, `nightly`, or an arbitrary label absent from the policy.

Post `/clear-labels` as the entire comment to remove every current label whose name starts with `run-ci`, plus `nightly` and `bypass-fastfail`. All other PR labels are preserved. This stops stale CI scope, cadence, fast-fail, and fork-approval choices from carrying into later pushes. It neither suppresses the ordinary always-on CI triggered by `synchronize` nor cancels a run that has already started.

Post `/rerun-failed-ci` as the entire comment to request failed-job reruns for the current open PR head. The handler considers only the latest run of each allowlisted PR workflow: `pre-commit.yml`, `pr-test.yml`, and `pr-test-rocm.yml`. A latest run is rerun only when it belongs to this PR and exact head SHA and has completed with conclusion `failure`.

Successful, skipped, cancelled, queued, or in-progress runs are not rerun, and a newer run prevents an older failure of the same workflow from being revived. The command does not touch CodeQL, `pull_request_target`, cleanup, scheduled, manually dispatched, or other control-plane workflows.

GitHub can omit `pull_requests` from fork workflow-run payloads. For a fork, the handler therefore also requires an all-state lookup by exact head owner and ref to identify only the current open PR, then binds each run to the same head ref, SHA, and repository ID. An absent, reused, or otherwise ambiguous fork head fails without a rerun.

The workflow is disabled by default. Workflow owners may set the repository variable `CI_COMMAND_APP_ENABLED=true` only after completing these steps:

1. Create a GitHub App, install it only on `radixark/miles`, and grant `Pull requests: read`, `Issues: write`, and `Actions: write`; do not grant `Contents: write`. Each request mints only one capability-specific token: label commands request `Issues: write`, while rerun commands request `Actions: write`.
2. Store the App client ID in the repository variable `CI_COMMAND_APP_CLIENT_ID` and its private key in the repository secret `CI_COMMAND_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
3. Protect the final bytes of `.github/workflows/comment-ci-command.yml`, the handler, and the policy: require code-owner review, enable stale-review dismissal or last-push approval, and explicitly accept administrators who can still bypass the rule as external trust roots.
4. In the target repository, compare manually adding a test label with adding the same label through the App. Confirm that both trigger the expected CUDA, ROCm, and held-run approval consumers.
   Then run `/clear-labels`; confirm that it removes only the CI control labels and does not start another CUDA, ROCm, or held-run approval workflow.
   Finally, create a disposable failed run on the current PR head and confirm that `/rerun-failed-ci` reruns only its failed jobs and dependent jobs.

The handler evaluates the caller against the checked-in access policy before minting the App token and again before label mutation begins. An explicit `add_label_access.user_ids` match uses the numeric comment-author identity bound to the event; otherwise the handler checks the caller's live repository permission. Rerun requests for one PR are serialized; before each rerun request, the handler rechecks the permission, PR head, and latest run of that workflow. Each lookup is a point-in-time result, so a small race remains between the final check and the mutation request.

The handler runs only fixed, reviewed code from the default branch and never checks out or executes PR code, dependencies, artifacts, or configuration. Initial authorization, PR, policy, or run-state errors fail before any mutation. A recheck error before a later rerun request stops that request, while any earlier accepted reruns remain applied.

If the additive label `POST`, a label `DELETE`, or a failed-job rerun `POST` was sent but its response timed out, was malformed, or could not be confirmed, GitHub may already have applied the change. `/clear-labels` and `/rerun-failed-ci` can issue multiple requests and are not atomic: if a later request fails, earlier changes remain applied. The handler does not retry or roll back automatically; inspect the PR's current labels or Actions runs before deciding whether to retry.

GitHub reruns failed jobs and their dependent jobs with the original run's `GITHUB_SHA`, `GITHUB_REF`, event payload, and triggering actor privileges. A rerun therefore does not inherit the commenter's or App token's privileges; consumers of the original event payload do not see labels changed afterward. GitHub permits reruns for up to 30 days after the original run and limits a workflow run to 50 attempts.

## Cadence eligibility

There are two CI cadences: `regular`, the ordinary mode; and `nightly`, which admits `nightly=True` tests, broadens the default scope, and bypasses fast-fail.

`register_*_ci(nightly=True)` means the test is eligible only under nightly cadence. It does not create a separate suite inventory and does not replace domain-label filtering. A regular run selects regular registrations only; a nightly run selects regular plus nightly-only registrations, then applies the same suite and domain-label filters to both. For example, a nightly-only test carrying only `ft-long` remains outside the standard nightly scope unless `run-ci-ft-long` or `run-ci-all` explicitly includes it.

## Broad CI scopes

The workflow's `resolve-ci-policy` job forwards trigger-specific facts to `tests/ci/ci_policy.py`; that module adapts them into explicit cadence and label inputs, then its shared `resolve_policy` maps those inputs to one effective include-label set and fast-fail policy. `run_suite.py` consumes the same resolved-policy function and never derives policy from `schedule` or `workflow_dispatch` event names. A broad scope is just a large include set (every registered label minus the scope's subtractions).

| Scope | Explicit source | Runs | Subtracts | Fast-fail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| all | `run-ci-all` label | every enabled tag | — | determined by cadence |
| nightly | resolved nightly cadence from the PR label, exact nightly cron, or local `--nightly` | every enabled tag except `long` and `ft-long`, incl. `ft-short` | `long`, `ft-long` | disabled on both levels (within-stage only for local runs) |
| image | `run-ci-image` label | every enabled tag except `long` and FT tags | `long`, `ft-short`, `ft-long` | determined by cadence |

Rows are in precedence order: when scope signals overlap, the higher row wins (`run-ci-all` > nightly > `run-ci-image`, the branch order of `resolve_policy`). `run-ci-all` widens only the domain scope; without nightly cadence it does not admit nightly-only registrations.

The generic triggers carry no policy. The current nightly schedule is identified by the exact cron string `0 15 * * *`; adding a weekly schedule requires a distinct cadence mapping rather than another `event_name == "schedule"` branch. A manual dispatch uses regular cadence and no PR labels, so it receives only the ordinary always-on scope; its existing operation inputs do not imply all or nightly.

A subtraction is not a per-test veto — it only stops that label from granting inclusion. A test carrying a subtracted label still runs when another of its labels is in the set, so a test that must stay outside the standard nightly scope must carry only labels that nightly subtracts.

A domain label explicitly requested on the PR wins over a scope subtraction: `run-ci-image` plus `run-ci-long` or `run-ci-ft-short`, and nightly plus `run-ci-long`, add the explicitly requested tests back rather than silently dropping the request.

## Registration and scan scope

Labels are optional; registration is not. The runner scans `tests/fast`, `tests/fast-gpu`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/ci` recursively for `test_*.py`. Every file must resolve to a registration or collection fails:

- A file outside `tests/fast/` with no `register_*_ci()` call → `No CI registry found`.
- A `labels=[...]` value not in `KNOWN_LABELS` → `unknown labels [...]`.

## `tests/fast/` auto-registers as CPU

Each `test_*.py` under `tests/fast/` is auto-registered as a CPU test (backend CPU, suite `stage-a-cpu`, `labels=[]`) with no `register_*_ci()` call, and runs on the GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` runner. Here "CPU" is the hardware backend, not a label. A `register_cuda_ci()` under `tests/fast/` is a hard error — move it to `tests/fast-gpu/`.

## `bypass-fastfail`: opt out of fast-fail

By default CI fails fast on two levels:

- Cross-stage: GPU stages run only when `stage-a-cpu` succeeds — the `if` requires `needs.stage-a-cpu.result == 'success'`.
- Within-stage: each suite stops at the first failure (`pytest -x` for CPU; `run_unittest_files` breaks on the first failing file for CUDA).

The `bypass-fastfail` PR label turns both off so one run surfaces every failure:

- Cross-stage: each GPU stage consumes the shared `bypass_fastfail` policy output, so GPU stages run even after `stage-a-cpu` fails.
- Within-stage: `run_suite.py` derives continue-on-error from the same resolved policy (drops `pytest -x`; sets `continue_on_error=True` for CUDA). The stage still ends red — it changes coverage, not the verdict.

A resolved nightly cadence bypasses fast-fail on both levels because a nightly is meant to exercise every eligible test except `long` and `ft-long` and surface every failure (one datapoint per test), not stop at the first. This applies equally whether the cadence came from the PR `nightly` label or the explicitly mapped nightly cron. Local `--nightly` applies the same selection and within-stage behavior; cross-stage gating does not exist in a local invocation.

Like the scope labels, `bypass-fastfail` is a workflow-only input and is not in `KNOWN_LABELS`.

## Labels double as fork-PR CI approval

GitHub holds a first-time contributor's fork-PR CI at "Approve and run" after every push. Any maintainer-applied or comment-gateway-authorized `run-ci*` label is already that human decision, so the `Approve Trusted CI` workflow (on `pull_request_target`) auto-approves the held runs while such a label is present. Removing the labels restores manual approval; the friction ends permanently once the contributor's first PR merges.
