title: Labels
description: The three kinds of CI label — domain labels that gate tests, scope labels that broaden selection, and bypass-fastfail.
---
A label is a GitHub PR label that changes what CI runs or how it fails. Three kinds:

| Kind | Example | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Domain label | `run-ci-megatron` | selects which tests run |
| Scope label | `run-ci-image` | run every enabled tag except `long`, `ft-short`, and `ft-long` |
| Cadence/scope label | `nightly` | select nightly cadence and every enabled tag except `long` and `ft-long`, with fast-fail disabled |
| Scope label | `run-ci-all` | run every enabled tag |
| Behavior label | `bypass-fastfail` | opt out of fast-fail; one run surfaces every failure |

Only domain labels are declared in `labels=[...]`; scope and behavior labels are workflow inputs resolved by `tests/ci/ci_policy.py`. The separate `nightly=True` registration field is a cadence gate described below.

## Domain labels: `register_*_ci(labels=...)` ↔ `run-ci-<x>`

A test declares its labels: `register_cuda_ci(..., labels=["megatron"])`. The PR trigger for `<x>` is the GitHub label `run-ci-<x>`. The workflow forwards canonical CI labels to `run_suite.py --labels`; Python strips the `run-ci-` prefix and intersects with each test's labels.

| Test declares | Runs when |
|---|---|
| `labels=[]` (or omitted) | every run whose cadence admits the test (always-on within that cadence) |
| `labels=["megatron"]` | PR has `run-ci-megatron` |
| `labels=["sglang"]` | PR has `run-ci-sglang` |
| `labels=["fsdp", "lora"]` | PR has `run-ci-fsdp` or `run-ci-lora` |

PR labels without the `run-ci-` prefix are ignored.

### The canonical label list

Domain labels live in `tests/ci/labels.py` (`KNOWN_LABELS`); a `labels=[...]` value outside it is a hard error. Current set: `megatron`, `model-scripts`, `sglang`, `fsdp`, `short`, `long`, `ckpt`, `lora`, `precision`, `ft-short`, `ft-long`, `weight-update`, `replay`, `qwen35`, `mooncake`.

To add one: add the entry to `KNOWN_LABELS`, then create the matching `run-ci-<key>` label on the PR. No workflow edit needed.

## Add CI labels from PR comments

After the comment gateway is enabled, post `/run-ci-<key>` as the entire comment on an open PR to append the matching `run-ci-<key>` label. For example, `/run-ci-short` requests only `run-ci-short`. The command permits leading and trailing whitespace only; it cannot include arguments, prose, a second command, or any other label. If the label is already present, the request succeeds as a no-op and does not emit another `labeled` event or rerun CI.

`.github/workflows/policies/ci-label-access.json` is an exact, default-deny ACL: each label maps to the live repository permission values allowed to request it. Adding a `KNOWN_LABELS` entry does not expose it through comments; an exact policy entry is also required.

The initial v1 policy exposes every current domain label and `run-ci-image` to callers whose live legacy permission on `radixark/miles` is `write` or `admin`. GitHub reports the `maintain` role as legacy `write`; custom roles follow their base repository access. The same permission check applies to same-repository and fork PRs; the policy has no static user-ID allowlist or separate fork gate.

The gateway controls only the delegated comment path for adding labels; it does not restrict users' existing GitHub UI/API label permissions. It only appends labels, never removes them, and does not expose `/run-ci-all`, `nightly`, `bypass-fastfail`, or a generic `/label` command. A successfully added label persists across later pushes; revoking authorization requires manually removing the label.

The workflow is disabled by default. Workflow owners may set the repository variable `CI_LABEL_APP_ENABLED=true` only after completing these steps:

1. Create a GitHub App, install it only on `radixark/miles`, and grant `Pull requests: read` and `Issues: write`; do not grant `Actions` or `Contents: write`.
2. Store the App client ID in the repository variable `CI_LABEL_APP_CLIENT_ID` and its private key in the repository secret `CI_LABEL_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
3. Protect the final bytes of `.github/workflows/comment-ci-label.yml`, the handler, and the policy: require code-owner review, enable stale-review dismissal or last-push approval, and explicitly accept administrators who can still bypass the rule as external trust roots.
4. In the target repository, compare manually adding a test label with adding the same label through the App. Confirm that both trigger the expected CUDA, ROCm, and held-run approval consumers, then remove the test label.

The handler checks the caller's live repository permission before minting the App token and checks it again immediately before mutation. Each lookup is a point-in-time result, so a small revocation race remains between the second check and the label `POST`.

The handler runs only fixed, reviewed code from the default branch and never checks out or executes PR code, dependencies, artifacts, or configuration. Requests detected as unauthorized, unknown, or malformed; closed PRs; deleted forks; identity mismatches; policy errors; and GitHub API errors while reading PR state all fail before any request to add a label is sent.

If the additive label `POST` was sent but its response timed out, was malformed, or could not be confirmed, GitHub may already have applied the change. The handler does not retry or roll it back automatically; inspect the PR's current labels before deciding whether to retry.

## Cadence eligibility

There are two CI cadences: `regular`, the ordinary mode; and `nightly`, which admits `nightly=True` tests, broadens the default scope, and bypasses fast-fail.

`register_*_ci(nightly=True)` means the test is eligible only under nightly cadence. It does not create a separate suite inventory and does not replace domain-label filtering. A regular run selects regular registrations only; a nightly run selects regular plus nightly-only registrations, then applies the same suite and domain-label filters to both. For example, a nightly-only test carrying only `ft-long` remains outside the standard nightly scope unless `run-ci-ft-long` or `run-ci-all` explicitly includes it.

## Broad CI scopes

The workflow's `resolve-ci-policy` job forwards trigger-specific facts to `tests/ci/ci_policy.py`; that module adapts them into explicit cadence and label inputs, then its shared `resolve_policy` maps those inputs to one effective include-label set and fast-fail policy. `run_suite.py` consumes the same resolved-policy function and never derives policy from `schedule` or `workflow_dispatch` event names. A broad scope is just a large include set (every registered label minus the scope's subtractions).

| Scope | Explicit source | Runs | Subtracts | Fast-fail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| all | `run-ci-all` label | every enabled tag | — | determined by cadence |
| nightly | resolved nightly cadence from the PR label, exact nightly cron, or local `--nightly` | every enabled tag except `long` and `ft-long`, incl. `ft-short` | `long`, `ft-long` | disabled on both levels (within-stage only for local runs) |
| image | `run-ci-image` label | every enabled tag except `long` and FT tags | `long`, `ft-short`, `ft-long` | determined by cadence |

Rows are in precedence order: when scope signals overlap, the higher row wins (`run-ci-all` > nightly > `run-ci-image`, the branch order of `resolve_policy`). `run-ci-all` widens only the domain scope; without nightly cadence it does not admit nightly-only registrations.

The generic triggers carry no policy. The current nightly schedule is identified by the exact cron string `0 15 * * *`; adding a weekly schedule requires a distinct cadence mapping rather than another `event_name == "schedule"` branch. A manual dispatch uses regular cadence and no PR labels, so it receives only the ordinary always-on scope; its existing operation inputs do not imply all or nightly.

A subtraction is not a per-test veto — it only stops that label from granting inclusion. A test carrying a subtracted label still runs when another of its labels is in the set, so a test that must stay outside the standard nightly scope must carry only labels that nightly subtracts.

A domain label explicitly requested on the PR wins over a scope subtraction: `run-ci-image` plus `run-ci-long` or `run-ci-ft-short`, and nightly plus `run-ci-long`, add the explicitly requested tests back rather than silently dropping the request.

## Registration and scan scope

Labels are optional; registration is not. The runner scans `tests/fast`, `tests/fast-gpu`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/ci` recursively for `test_*.py`. Every file must resolve to a registration or collection fails:

- A file outside `tests/fast/` with no `register_*_ci()` call → `No CI registry found`.
- A `labels=[...]` value not in `KNOWN_LABELS` → `unknown labels [...]`.

## `tests/fast/` auto-registers as CPU

Each `test_*.py` under `tests/fast/` is auto-registered as a CPU test (backend CPU, suite `stage-a-cpu`, `labels=[]`) with no `register_*_ci()` call, and runs on the GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` runner. Here "CPU" is the hardware backend, not a label. A `register_cuda_ci()` under `tests/fast/` is a hard error — move it to `tests/fast-gpu/`.

## `bypass-fastfail`: opt out of fast-fail

By default CI fails fast on two levels:

- Cross-stage: GPU stages run only when `stage-a-cpu` succeeds — the `if` requires `needs.stage-a-cpu.result == 'success'`.
- Within-stage: each suite stops at the first failure (`pytest -x` for CPU; `run_unittest_files` breaks on the first failing file for CUDA).

The `bypass-fastfail` PR label turns both off so one run surfaces every failure:

- Cross-stage: each GPU stage consumes the shared `bypass_fastfail` policy output, so GPU stages run even after `stage-a-cpu` fails.
- Within-stage: `run_suite.py` derives continue-on-error from the same resolved policy (drops `pytest -x`; sets `continue_on_error=True` for CUDA). The stage still ends red — it changes coverage, not the verdict.

A resolved nightly cadence bypasses fast-fail on both levels because a nightly is meant to exercise every eligible test except `long` and `ft-long` and surface every failure (one datapoint per test), not stop at the first. This applies equally whether the cadence came from the PR `nightly` label or the explicitly mapped nightly cron. Local `--nightly` applies the same selection and within-stage behavior; cross-stage gating does not exist in a local invocation.

Like the scope labels, `bypass-fastfail` is a workflow-only input and is not in `KNOWN_LABELS`.

## Labels double as fork-PR CI approval

GitHub holds a first-time contributor's fork-PR CI at "Approve and run" after every push. Any maintainer-applied `run-ci*` label is already that human decision, so the `Approve Trusted CI` workflow (on `pull_request_target`) auto-approves the held runs while such a label is present. Removing the labels restores manual approval; the friction ends permanently once the contributor's first PR merges.
